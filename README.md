## 🚀 What is VantageJS?

**VantageJS** is a blazing-fast CLI tool, written in Rust, that helps developers **detect and eliminate performance pitfalls** in JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Inspired by the aura of ESLint, VantageJS brings V8 optimization insights directly into your development workflow – whether you're writing vanilla JS, building SPAs with React/Vue, or working with Node.js.

> 🧠 Designed with precision. Built for scale. Powered by Rust.

## 🎯 Core Features (v0.0.1 MVP)

- ⚡ Lightning-fast CLI initialization
- 🎉 Stylish terminal banner to mark your territory
- ✅ Foundation for future static code analysis of:
    - V8 optimization pitfalls
    - Hidden performance traps (e.g., deopts, inline cache misses)
    - Memory leaks & GC hotspots

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- ✅ CLI Bootstrapped in Rust
- 🧠 V8 Optimization Rule Engine (WIP)
- 🧪 AST parsing and pattern detection
- 🌐 Support for JS, TS, Node.js, and modern JS frameworks
- 🔌 Editor Integrations (VSCode, WebStorm)
- 📊 Team Dashboard (SaaS – Phase 2)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (`>= 1.60`)
- Cargo

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabulousDesigns/vantagejs.git
cd vantagejs
cargo run
```

### 🧩 Philosophy
> We believe that performance should be part of your code's linting process.

VantageJS is here to bring that future – today. We strip away human bias by relying on research from the official [V8 Blog](https://v8.dev/blog) and Rust’s raw power to build an ESLint-style performance engine that understands the JS runtime like V8 does.

### 🤝 Contributing
