## The Problem

Modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Next.js make it easy to build complex applications, but they also make it easy to introduce subtle performance issues that only manifest at scale:

- Components that trigger excessive re-renders
- Functions that cause V8 deoptimizations in hot paths
- Patterns that break inline caching in the V8 engine
- Memory leaks from stale closures and forgotten references
- Inefficient data structures that create GC pressure

These issues are difficult to detect during development and often only become apparent when users report slowness in production. By then, the performance debt is already affecting your business.

**Current solutions fall short:**

- Runtime profilers only show problems after they occur
- Existing linters focus on code style and potential bugs, not performance
- Performance optimization requires deep knowledge of V8 internals
- Manual code reviews can't consistently catch all performance pitfalls

## Our Solution

VantageJS is an ESLint-like static analysis tool that scans your React and Next.js code to identify patterns known to cause performance issues in the V8 JavaScript engine.

**Key features:**

- **Static analysis**: Catch performance issues before your code runs
- **V8-focused rules**: Based on research and patterns from the V8 team
- **Framework-aware**: Specific rules for React and Next.js optimization
- **Clear explanations**: Learn why an issue impacts performance and how to fix it
- **VSCode integration**: See warnings directly in your editor as you code

## How It Works

VantageJS analyzes your codebase for common V8 performance pitfalls:

1. **Function optimization killers** - Patterns that prevent V8 from optimizing your functions
2. **Megamorphic operations** - Code that breaks V8's inline caching system
3. **Hidden class transitions** - Object mutations that slow down property access
4. **React-specific issues** - Components with expensive re-render patterns
5. **Next.js optimizations** - Inefficient data fetching and routing patterns

## Getting Started

Our first MVP will be delivered as a VSCode extension. Stay tuned for installation instructions and early access.

## Roadmap

- [x] Core concept and rule definitions
- [ ] VSCode extension (MVP)
- [ ] CLI tool integration
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Custom rule configuration
- [ ] Automated fixes for common issues

## Why Rust?

VantageJS is built with Rust to ensure:

- Lightning-fast analysis even on large codebases
- Memory safety and reliability
- Efficient cross-platform distribution
